### Bar Plot 

This plot was created to compare how different groups in the Austin area are affected by the selected variable. Each bar represents the average value for census block groups with a population greater than 50%. For example, the value for '>50% Hispanic' takes the average of all the census block groups with greater than 50% Hispanic or Latino. 

### Box Plot 
 
The box plot takes the same data and visualizes the variation between groups. If you would like to read how to interpret box plots you can click [here](https://www.wellbeingatschool.org.nz/information-sheet/understanding-and-interpreting-box-plots).



**The red dotted line shows the average values for all groups.**
