The [Austin Area Sustainability Indicators]("http://www.austinindicators.org/") project (A2SI), an initiative at the University of Texas at Austin, aims is to measure the quality of life, sustainability trends, and serve as the foundation to address challenges in Central Texas. Indicators describe context, identify trends, and translate data into points that are easier to communicate. These indicators span air quality, population demographics, health, mobility, economy, and the environment.
